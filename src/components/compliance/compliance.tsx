              Notice of Privacy Practices (HIPAA)
            </h2>

            <p>
              This notice describes how medical information about you may be
              used and disclosed and how you can get access to this information.
              Please review it carefully. Harmony Health will be referred to in
              this Notice of Privacy Practices ("Notice") as "Harmony". This
              Notice is given to you by a Harmony Facility to describe the ways
              in which Harmony may use and disclose your medical information
              (called "protected health information" or "PHI") and to notify you
              of your rights with respect to PHI in the possession of Harmony
              Health. Harmony Health protects the privacy of PHI, which also is
              protected from disclosure by state and federal law. In certain
              circumstances, pursuant to this Notice, patient authorization or
              applicable laws and regulations, PHI can be used by Harmony Health
              or disclosed to other parties. Below are categories describing
              these uses and disclosures, along with some examples to help you
              better understand each category.

              Uses and Disclosures for Treatment, Payment and Health Care
              Operations
            </h3>
            <p>
              Harmony Health may use or disclose your PHI for the purposes of
              treatment, payment and health care operations, described in more
              detail below, without obtaining written authorization from you.
            </p>

            <h4 className="font-semibold mt-3">For Treatment:</h4>
            <p>
              Harmony Health may use and disclose PHI in the course of
              providing, coordinating, or managing your medical treatment,
              including the disclosure of PHI for treatment activities at
              another healthcare facility. These types of uses and disclosures
              may take place between physicians, nurses, technicians, students,
              and other health care professionals who provide your health care
              services or are otherwise involved in your care. For example, if
              you are being treated by a primary care physician, that physician
              may need to use/disclose PHI to a specialist physician whom he or
              she consults regarding your condition, or to a nurse who is
              assisting in your care.
            </p>

            <h4 className="font-semibold mt-3">For Payment:</h4>
            <p>
              Harmony Health may use and disclose PHI to collect payment for the
              health care services provided to you. For example, Harmony Health
              may need to give PHI to your health plan to be reimbursed for the
              services provided to you. Harmony Health may also disclose PHI to
              their business associates, such as billing companies, claims
              processing companies, and others that assist in processing health
              claims. Harmony Health may also disclose PHI to other health care
              providers and health plans for the payment activities of such
              providers or health plans.
            </p>

            <h4 className="font-semibold mt-3">For Health Care Operations:</h4>
            <p>
              Harmony Health may use and disclose PHI as part of their
              operations, including for quality assessment and improvement, such
              as evaluating the treatment and services you receive and the
              performance of our staff in caring for you. Other activities
              include hospital training, underwriting activities, compliance and
              risk management activities, planning and development, and
              management and administration. Harmony Health may disclose PHI to
              doctors, nurses, technicians, students, attorneys, consultants,
              accountants, and others for review and learning purposes. These
              disclosures help make sure that Harmony Health is complying with
              all applicable laws and are continuing to provide health care to
              patients at a high level of quality. Harmony Health may also
              disclose PHI to other health care facilities plans for certain of
              their operations, including their quality assessment and
              improvement activities, credentialing and peer review activities,
              and health care fraud and abuse detection or compliance, provided
              that those other facilities and plans have, or have had in the
              past, a relationship with the patient who is the subject of the
              information.
            </p>

            <h4 className="font-semibold mt-3">
              For Sharing PHI Among Harmony Health and Professional Staff:
            </h4>
            <p>
              Harmony Health works together with physicians and other care
              providers on their professional staff to provide medical services
              to you when you are a patient at a Harmony Health Facility.
              Harmony Health and members of their respective professional staff
              will share PHI with each other as needed to perform their
              treatment, payment and health care operations activities.
